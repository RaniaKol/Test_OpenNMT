The government, aware of their inability to prevent this, and of the danger they should be in, if left out of the capitulation, publicly agreed with Paches and the army to surrender Mitylene at discretion and to admit the troops into the understanding that the understanding that the Mitylenians should be able to send an embassy to Athens to plead their cause, and attend to the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens of the citizens until the citizens and to the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens until the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the ears of the ears of the citizens until the citizens until the citizens of the citizens would have been seen the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the
